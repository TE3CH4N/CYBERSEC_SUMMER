### Reflection:
This week was stressful week as Summer studio had started right after my 9am Careers Management class, which obviously interrupted it. Thus, I informed my Careers Management (CMITP) tutor few weeks prior to the start of Summer Studio, so that within the hour of class CMITP, my group and I will have presentation priority, so that we will not miss anything crucial.

When summer studio came about I was immediately confronted with an  abundance of "to-do" items.

Concepts I had to be wary of when i joined the class:
- Get familiar with the subject outline and its SLO's
- Join MS Teams
- Open Wiki tab under Cyber Security Summer Studio and follow instructions under Week 1
- Download Github education pack to enjoy all the content available for 12 months
- Learn how Git and how repositories work (learn how to gain remote access/push + pull)
- Learn about how Hugo server converts to HTML/CSS (external research) server
- Do some external research about emerging cyber security issues in the real world

Errors I managed to fix and what I learnt from them:

keep having "error: 'themes/' does not have a commit checked out fatal: adding files failed" issue when trying to upload local repos to GitHub

Add files to stage —> Commit the files —> push the file onto online repo

Another Problem I had was deploying site on netlify was it wans't the right hugo version:

- I fixed this by checking the version of HUGO on my terminal (version 0.62.2) and then i matched it on Netlify under Site Settings/build & deploy/Environment
