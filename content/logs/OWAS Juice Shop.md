2. Check if email and password to be true in database (TRUE & TRUE) (1 = 1)

Object object just shows error handling â€”> shows a successful sql injection attempt

Now that I've seen my scoreboard, I can pick the next task to accomplish

Accidentally did the privacy policy task as I logged in

I chose to pick Confidential Document task:

- "Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application, company, or other entity inadvertently exposes personal data. Sensitive data exposure differs from a data breach, in which an attacker accesses and steals information."

List of steps I took:

- Read the guide on hacksplaining
-

Next task was the Missing Encoding task:

1. Go to Photo Wall
2. Right Click + Inspect Element
3. Ctrl + F to search by filter and find the image link with hashtags
4. Replaced all # in the image link to %23 (html code for hastag)
5. Clicked outside the elements box and the page refreshed, allowing the image to be recognisd and voila!

2.  By replacing it with %23, html code can recognise the image link
