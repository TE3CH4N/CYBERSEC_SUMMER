#### Career Goals
***
I have taken a deep interest into both UX/UI Design and Cyber Security ever since I started university, which made me quite indecisive about which career pathway I want to aim towards. I would say I am a "Jack of all trades" type of person, meaning I have a decent arsenal of skills & knowledge in both fields, however, my skills are not particularly refined for one specific IT field. Thus, Interaction Design has been my Major and Cyber Security being my SubMajor, I have not achieved much in terms of Industry Cyber Security knowledge, other than skills I have learnt from Networking (CCNA) and Security subjects. I really hope to gain a heightened understanding within the Cyber Security industry and to ultimately help me decide which career path I enjoy more.

#### Motivations and Learning Goals
***
My main source of motivation was that I needed an some sort of project-based experince to imitate a professional Cyber Security industry, in order for me to commit to the Cyber Security career pathway. Hence, convincing me to pick up Summer Studio 03: Cyber Security. Additionally, I wanted to start developing a good habit of recording my research and feedback (if applicable), and be able to reflect on that every week in order to see where I could improve on, what made me fall behind in class that required me to conduct external "Googling" and what tacit knowledge or skills I already possess that I'm already using in class. Thus, by the end of this Summer Studio, I wish I to acquire enough knowledge to make an informed decision about my pathway and have a solid foundation of Industry skills so I am capable to help others in need.

#### Group Contributions
***
As briefly mentioned in my learning contract, I will try my best to utilise my creative skills to contribute to my group brainstorm sessions and to also utilise my strong communication skills to actively listen to every group members' contributions in order to avoid any unnecessary conflict. Furthermore, through group deliverables and by rotating group members every week, I certainly look forward to develop my public speaking skills and to also develop the ability to grasp certain concepts reasonably well, so that I am able to present and teach the topic to other students.
