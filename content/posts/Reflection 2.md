#### Introduction
***
***
This is the 2nd week of Cyber Security Summer Studio and I feel as if this week was much more manageable than last week with the ongoing support from my tutors. Nevertheless, the workload was still intense, but I definitely have a better understanding of what is expected of me now. Consequently, I immediately started to take more responsibility into documenting the daily tasks that I do, which can viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/teechan/Submission-2-notes-d1c8d669faec4f2aa264e9a03ab76eea). This week we were introduced to two guest speakers (stakeholders), and had taught us a lot about their respective topics. Patrick introduced us to interesting and unique variations of Linux and other window managers while Robert briefed us on the history of IT security and the evolution of IT security threats along with their appropriate risk management strategies.
This provoked me into coming up with a problem statement.






Talk about developing problem statement acquired from stakeholders: Patrick Kelso and Robert Mitchell.

#### Systolic v Diastolic
*Note to self:* *Include a picture of things that went well vs things that didn't go well this week written in notebook*

###### Pros:
- Plan to do list on notebook and document notes on notion
- Engaged with other students and stakeholders
- This included talking to Patrick Kelso, and asking him about his experience working in IT security, especially in the government funded hospital where he talked about limited funding, which really provoked one of my problem statements
- This also includes talking with Robert and understanding that there any chances in the IT security field where UX/UI designers could thrive, and he suggested that many security products or technical content has difficulty providing a user-friendly layout for everyday users
- Asked what I wanted during the 1 on 1 consultation sessions regarding career goals and reflection two draft
***
###### Cons:
- Did not write any notes regarding other student presentations
- I have been procrastinating quite a bit since there was only the reflection due this week, which yet again led me to finish reflection on the weekend :(
- Did not give enough feedback to tutors about their teaching style. However, if you guys are reading this, I would like to really **emphasise** my point again. `I really appreciate the effort you guys put in to teach us and the genuine personal connection you have provided me, which makes me feel very welcome and not afraid to ask questions. :)`

#### Goals for next week
