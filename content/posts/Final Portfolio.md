##### SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills
***
***
Talk about how effective communication skills are in order to collaborate well within a team, especially within the Info security or even just any IT workplace.

I have learnt that in order to better understand a technical concept, learning the concept through other fellow students' and teaching team's demonstrations is not enough. However, if I was able to effectively demonstrate or explain a topic to other people with no knowledge of this technical concept, then I feel much more accomplished, as I will also have a better understanding of the topic while I teach others (`win win?`).

#### Future Intentions
I have definitely learnt a lot from my summer studio and with this knowledge gained...
- Still unsure whether to lean towards UX or Cyber Security as I am still quite an indecisive person in general.
- However, have a deeper insight into what the cyber security industry is like and the typical workload that is presented to you, based on my own input and suggestions from Info sec industry professionals that came to visit our studio.
