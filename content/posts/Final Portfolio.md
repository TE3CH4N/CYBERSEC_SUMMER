#### About me
***
***
If you have forgotten about me since Week 1 --> Here is a little `About Me`:

My name is Dylan Tchan and I am an enthusiastic 3rd year UTS student studying Science in Information Technology. I am extremely passionate and have taken a deep interest in two areas of IT: `UX Design` and `Cyber Security`. Although studying two majors is quite interesting, it has made me quite indecisive about which career pathway I want to aim towards. I would say I am a “Jack of all trades” type of person, meaning I have a decent arsenal of skills & knowledge in both fields, however, my skills are not particularly refined for one specific IT field. However, at the end of what I have learnt from this Summer Studio, I am definitely leaning more towards the `Cyber Security` side, as I am now more confident in my technical abilities and more aware of what is required of me within a Cyber Security Industry. Nevertheless, my main ***long-term*** goal is to educate users on information security by creating a more satisfying user environment for them to learn and understand the technical content.
***
***
#### Introduction
***
***
The `Cyber Security Summer Studio C` has played a major factor in my technical and presentation skillset development, as it ultimately enhanced my overall confidence, especially when I need to explain technical security content to a non-technical user, and when I am attempting different security challenges. Likewise, recalling back to when I was filling out the [learning contract](https://teechan.me/2020/01/post-1/) for my first introduction submission, I strongly believe that I have successfully met the learning requirements and goals that I have set for myself there.

Moreover, the rest of the portfolio will cover my final overview of my past sprint submissions and logs, along with sufficient evidence on how I have been able to fulfil the `Summer Studio C's` five `Subject Learning Outcomes` (SLO's). I cannot appreciate enough how much effort the teaching team have exerted for me to reap the benefits. They have given me countless online learning resources and immediate feedback from our 1 on 1 sessions, which has benefitted my learning immensely. Once again, I would like to thank the Cyber Security teaching team: `Jason`, `Larry` and `Max`, as well as `Roger` (our Summer Studio Leader) from the bottom of my heart for organising such a wonderful, yet intriguing learning experience.

#### Final Summary
***
***
##### SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
***
***

I found this particular subject learning outcome quite confusing to wrap my head around at first, as there was no clear explanation about this particular learning outcome. Thus, I immediately took initiative and brought it up to the teaching team. They later clarified that these problems have to be real industry related problems, in which my task is to come up with an appropriate yet, feasible solution to these problems.

I soon found out through the first 1 on 1 session with my tutors, that our studio was slightly different than other studios in the sense that our problem statements could change every week. This meant that we did not have to stick with one problem statement and completely focus on designing a solution for that statement for the rest of the session like other studios. Moreover, our problem statements could also be influenced by either a relevant industry problem brought upon by different stakeholders or through our experience with technical tools throughout the Summer Studio.

Throughout the weeks, here are the problem statements that I have discussed with stakeholders, who are currently working in the Cyber Security Industry:
- Week 2:
`"IoT devices may be compromised and used for performing massive DDoS attacks. Cybercriminals may try to exploit these poor security settings in both, home and workplace IoT devices, making them generate enormous amounts of traffic, in which any device is an attack vector."`
  - This was influenced by `Patrick Kelso`, who is a cloud manager, and `Robert Mitchell`, who is an engineer manager at Gitlab.
***
- Week 4:
`"Penetration Testing is not comprehensive enough and can do real damage"`
  - This was influenced by my own thorough research, along with discussions with my teaching team while we learnt different Pen-Testing tips.
***
- Week 5:
`"How costly are Cyber risks from the human element and how will they affect businesses?"`
  - This was influenced by Pieter Westein and Nathan Jones from Deloitte.
***
Through their perspective and along with my in-depth research, I have found a common underlying theme: Human error being the main source of cyber risks. Thus, this allowed me to refine down to a single, yet intriguing problem statement that covers a lot of security aspects:
***
`The most overlooked element to any malicious cyber risk is human error. It contributes to most of a company's data breaches. In a security context, human error means unintentional actions or the lack of action, which when cause, spread or allow a security breach to take place.`
***
The problem with our 21st century is the business of emerging technology, along with the exponential expansion of technology, is that it shifts too fast. Consequently, many companies choose to utilise new and emerging technology, which prefers automation over manual labour. This also results in the company neglecting to train new employees on these new machines, especially when it comes to educating non-technical employees regarding information security. The lack of awareness and the negligent environment that these new employees are brought up upon, will highly likely influence poor skill-based and decision-based errors in the future, which will rapidly increase the company's vulnerability to the next cyber threat in return.

Thus, throughout the studio, by successfully achieving root access to several vulnerable virtual machines, I have discovered that it is definitely possible to go from an insecure website (whether it would be an outdated server or unpatched system) to acquiring root/admin access of the machine. Moreover, the fact that certain exploits are very easy to look online (especially on [Exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/)), makes the cyber risk factor even more dangerous and should serve as a sign of precaution to many companies to constantly update and patch their software after its release to avoid any unnecessary cyber hazards.

Furthermore, another vital precaution that companies should be aware of is that if `black-hat` hackers are able to acquire admin access to a particular system, they can do whatever they want with the machine. This will include, but is not limited to: Accessing all the employees' usernames and passwords and threaten to release all of them to the public and even gain a competitive advantage over the target company by altering their sales records to ultimately result in a detriment to the target company's financial value and status which will dismiss any business stakeholders.
***
***
##### SLO 2 - Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem
***
***
This was another difficult subject learning outcome to thoroughly describe as `applying design thinking` was a continuous process throughout the whole studio. Think of it as the continuous evaluation process of a project, which is demonstrated by a Gantt Chart.

Initially, I also struggled with this learning outcome as I had limited knowledge about penetration testing and barely had any Linux skillsets. However, with the constant feedback from the teaching team and their ongoing support, I was able to effectively apply design thinking when we were challenged with many virtual boxes. Every week, we were challenged with different boxes from different sites like [TryHackme](https://tryhackme.com) and [HacktheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). Likewise, we also learnt basic Linux skills through [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) and [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). Evidence for this particular skillset development can be found [here](https://teechan.me/logs/).

I have realised that the more practice I have at Pen-Testing these vulnerable machines (that were meant to replicate past real world vulnerabilities), the more I realise the severity of a company's vulnerability, especially when they are not being diligent enough to update and patch their systems. Thus, prompting me to effectively apply design thinking to avoid these potential security hazards. Furthermore, the teaching team has also enlightened me on a general overview of how a basic web penetration testing methodology should be structured, and encouraged me to follow that method. (refer to screenshot below):

![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/penmeth.png)
***

Although Jason (fellow tutor) has shortened the whole pen-testing methodology down to only `define`, `ideate`, `test` and `implement`, I had only followed it up until around the start of Week 4, where harder challenges from [HacktheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) arose as deliverables, in which I needed to adopt a better yet simpler methodology when solving challenges. I ended up using the three E's method instead:
***
1. Enumeration:
    - Define your goal and keep that in mind as you will need it to brainstorm ideas about where to start enumerating
    - Enumerate a system's files to find a potential exploit or lead
    - Continuous Process

2. Exploitation:
    - Find potential exploit/s
    - Research about those potential exploit/s
    - Start testing each exploit and techniques through trial and error
    - Repeat the ideation process if necessary or until you find the right exploit

3. Escalation:
    - Progress further into the box by implementing successful techniques that emphasises your goal
    - Do not stop after finding the first flag, keep going until you have root/admin access

--- **RINSE & REPEAT** ---
***
Thus, by applying this simple yet effective methodology, I was able to apply critical design thinking throughout the process and started to further realise the severity of the impact that businesses and their companies would confront if their systems were as outdated and insecure like the boxes I had attempted. Additionally, I have also gained a heightened understanding of the reputation and financial damage to the company if it was as exposed as the virtual machines themselves. Thus, providing me with a source of motivation and a further insight on constructing a clear problem statement for the first subject learning outcome.
***
***
##### SLO 3 - Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design
***
***

Instead of thoroughly describing the development process for my technical skillset throughout the studio, which I have already [documented](https://teechan.me/posts/) every week, I have decided that it will much easier if I list out the main technical skills I have developed every week.
***
- Week 1:
    - First week was not really cyber security focused, as we were told to understand the basics of how to setup a static site:

    ![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/week1.png)
    - Understanding the basics of `Git` and how Github Repositories work (learn how to gain remote access/push + pull)
    - Struggled at first, but with the help of fellow students and tutors, I managed to pull through
***
- Week 2:
    - Learnt about **technical** scanning tools NMAP (Network Mapper), which is an intensive port scanning tool
    - Produced a presentation about NMAP with Hayden and Nik using Canva, which can be viewed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DADyQuNdQao/obR8xGLrPcD9WVdvrNicbg/view?utm_content=DADyQuNdQao&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).
    - Learnt more skills within the Linux Command line while completing `Capture the flag` challenges such as [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) and [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). You can view my logs over [here](https://teechan.me/logs/).

      ![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/pico1.png)
    - The main goal for this week was to utilise these capture the flag challenges as a platform or resource to better understand Linux's Operating System.
***
- Week 3:
    - Attempted Bandit again on [overthewire](www.overthewire.org), which allowed me to brush up on Linux skills again
    - Started attempting another web-based wargame in [overthewire](www.overthewire.org) and documented the process [here](https://teechan.me/logs/natas-logs/)
    - Since our topic this week was web exploitation, we had to pick a topic regarding web exploitation and present with our new group members, which included Anthony, Tyrone and I. Our slides for the topic `Broken Access Control` can be viewed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DADyvPVnau0/fZvUZg6nzkgsgIkhiaiheA/view?utm_content=DADyvPVnau0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
    - Did most of my **technical content** research on this fascinating website called [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/)

    ![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/hacksplaining1.png)
    - **Techniques** I have learnt this week include: Web Application based exploit tools such as `Sql Injection`, utilising the `Inspect Element + Console` within a web browser and learning how `Broken Access Control` works.
***
- Week 4:
    - This week, we were challenged to submit our very first `boot2root` challenge as a deliverable.
    - Get used to the `tryhackme` platform
    - I managed to complete two simple/intermediate boxes, which were `Vulnversity` and `Basic Pentesting 1`.
    - Vulnversity's writeup can be found [here](https://teechan.me/logs/tryhackme-vulnerversity/)
    - Basic Pentesting 1's writeup can be found [here](https://teechan.me/logs/basic-pentesting-1/)
    - Tried to attempt another `tryhackme` box called Biohazard with another student (Tyrone) for extra practice, but only managed to get halfway through it. Biohazard writeup can be found [here](https://teechan.me/logs/tryhackme-biohazard/)
    - Thus, **technical concepts** I have developed this week are: learning how `openvpn` works, learning how to properly use flags for an `Nmap` scan, learn how to enumerate directories using `Gobuster`, how to escalate your privilege as normal user using a `reverse shell` and learning about different base encoding formats for encryption and learning about extra encryption methods such as: using `Vignere` ciphers and utilising `ROT13`
***
- Week 5 + 6:
    - Focused on the `Hackthebox` platform as the boxes get more interesting at a more intermediate level
    - Based on the knowledge I gained from the previous boxes I had attempted, I attempted two `hackthebox` boxes, which had **similar technical challenges** to `Vulnversity`, and this really helped speed up the enumerating process up as I knew which exploits worked and which did not work
    - Further learnt new technical skills such as `Netcat`, `Netstat`, `ssh2john` and `curl`
    - Managed to complete `Openadmin` and `Traverxec` respectively, which can be viewed [here](https://teechan.me/logs/), however due to `Hackthebox` rules, I am not allowed to post writeups publicly unless I protect them with a password and only show to stakeholders (my teaching team in this case).
    - I will be posting them publicly after the machine has been retired

  Throughout the studio, I have realised that these tools are necessary in order to traverse through a system and obtain root, especially if you follow the general pen-testing methodology. Likewise, the exposure to these new technical tools have been crucial to my learning experience as they have improved my confidence in using these tools for future boxes, as I had very limited understanding of any tools prior to starting this summer studio.
***
***
##### SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills
***
***
During the first few weeks of the studio, we were required to make a group presentation on different cyber security related topics. This prompted me to establish strong connections with my fellow peers in order to better understand them in order to meet a common goal. Strong communication and collaboration skills are highly valuable skills in the workplace and are essential for project succession. Here is what happened every week that effectively shows my constant collaboration and communication between fellow students and the teaching team:
***
- Week 1:
    - Asked tutors during the mandatory 1 on 1 session regarding the overall layout/format and content of my static site, in return for some feedback that I can use to further improve upon
***
- Week 2:
    - Group presentation on `Nmap`

    ![Untitled.png](/images/teamsweek2.png)
    - Further in-depth artefacts and explanation on how I collaborated [here](https://teechan.me/2020/01/reflection-2/)
***
- Week 3:
    - Group presentation on a web exploit topic
    - Our group picked `Broken Access Control`

    ![Untitled.png](/portfolio/bac.png)
    - Further discussion with Anthony (fellow students) as he is using the same Hugo theme as me. He suggested I should utilise `Favicons` to further customise my webpage and to make it look even better
    - Further in-depth artefacts and explanation on how I collaborated [here](https://teechan.me/2020/02/reflection-3/)

***
- Week 5 + 6:
    - Prepare a group presentation for the final summer studio project demonstration on a `hackthebox` box called `Openadmin`
    - Slides can be viewed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAD06vZ1_Gc/MKdqoUsrheucawdP7wEbsw/view?utm_content=DAD06vZ1_Gc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
    - We discussed how we were going allocated the sub-topics of our presentation to each member of the group and who will be recording the demonstrate
    - Since we know most of the members of the class by now, it made it extremely easy to effectively communicate between one another, especially because we do not feel the need to refrain from asking simple questions or even ask for tips on their presentation style
    - Further in-depth artefacts and explanation on how I collaborated [here](https://teechan.me/2020/02/reflection-5/), and [here](https://teechan.me/2020/03/reflection-6/)
***
As you could determine from the evidence I provided, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, Trello and Discord were the main source of communication between me and the teaching team and was also the main source for collaboration work between fellow peers to organise team presentations or just to seek help from others in general.  

Furthermore, based on the meet-ups for team presentations and the standup `scrum` meetings our studio holds every week, it allows everyone to see where we all are individually, and based on that knowledge, we tend to help others in need based on their strengths and weaknesses. It satisfies me to see everyone had a common strength or weakness at some point during a stand-up meeting, but it was more so for everyone to practice their `on-the-spot` presentation skills and to effectively reflect on what they did for the week, so they can improve upon themselves.

I have also learnt that in order to better understand a technical concept, learning the concept through other fellow students' and teaching team's demonstrations is not enough. However, if I was able to effectively demonstrate or explain a topic to other people with no knowledge of this technical concept, then I feel much more accomplished, as I will also have a better understanding of the topic while I teach others (`win win?`).

Since I had to balance out between two subjects, which were this summer studio and my careers management for IT professionals class, it really showed me how jumping in between message mediums (MS Teams --> Facebook Messenger --> Then back to MS Teams again) and giving tutors a `heads up` of what will happening throughout the upcoming weeks allows both sides to stay updated and avoid any unnecessary conflict.

Thus, from this subject learning outcome, I can immediately depict that employees require strong communication skills in order to effectively collaborate well within a team, especially within the Info security or even just any IT workplace. Furthermore, understanding your own emotions and how to appropriately judge situations is another contributing factor in effective communication, which ties perfectly well with the next subject learning outcome.
***
***
##### SLO 5 - Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation
***
***
From this subject learning outcome, I have recognised that it is extremely crucial to be honest with yourself and it is definitely okay to accept your own flaws, as long as you continuously work on it to improve upon yourself.  Moreover, it is also very important to understand your own emotions and in others as well in terms of how it will affect their performance. Having strong emotional intelligence not only allows you to understand and reflect on your overall progress, but to ultimately see how others are going and see if they are in need of assistance.

Throughout the studio, making reflection logs, which can be viewed [here](https://teechan.me/posts/), allowed me to reflect back on the week as I read through it several weeks later. However, it was not an easy process as I was not used to documenting my weekly tasks (nor daily). Nevertheless, I powered through and stuck with the sprint submissions every week, and based on the positive feedback I have received, it has been a good source of motivation and it even has encouraged me to document every security challenge I attempt in the future.

Thus, by documenting what my strengths and weaknesses are and what I have or have not accomplished every week, allowed me to 'keep track' of my `fresh` emotions and how I felt at the time. It is also critically important to look back and reflect upon the earlier weeks, as you are able to compare yourself now with yourself from the earlier weeks to see whether you have improved and to evaluate your overall performance.

Here are some screenshots of the feedback I have received from the teaching team and as you can see, they have significantly improved overtime
- Week 1:
![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/feedback1.png)
***
- Week 2:
![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/feedback2.png)
***
- Week 3 + 4:
![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/feedback3.png)
![Screenshot4.png](/portfolio/feedback4.png)
***

From the feedback received from the tutors:
- Perhaps utilise another theme or design layout where I do not just explicitly state the learning outcomes, but rather adopt a style similar to Jason's blog posts, where it is very easy to understand what I have achieved throughout the week
- I have learnt a better method of allowing the teaching team to evaluate my performance and sprint submissions. This method was to thoroughly describe what I have learnt from the week and the teaching team can automatically assume whether or not you have met the learning outcomes for the week, rather than listing our every Subject Learning Outcome (SLO) and then tediously recounting and explaining the whole process
- To not be afraid of asking questions, as it will not only benefit you but the whole class as well
- Encouraged that it is okay to not feel contempt about your work at times because I have seriously felt invaluable to a group contribution during the first few weeks, only because I was not keeping up with the content or just inexperienced in general. However, their feedback prompted me to extra work and research on the side, just so that I am able to keep up with the rest of the class.

Overall, I found myself critically analysing my performance throughout the studio under a conclusion `tldr` section, and although I was aware that I had minimal experience with cyber security initially, along with my poor time management (funky way of saying `procrastination`), I put any self-doubts aside and powered through the submissions and even surprised myself with how much work I have displayed and the amount of knowledge I have gained over the course of 6 weeks.

#### Conclusion
***
***
When I initially started out in this subject, I was really indecisive on whether or not I should take this subject. Additionally, I had no sense of direction or career goal in mind, I was only going in with some prior experience from Networking and Cyber Security subjects I took from at UTS. Consequently, while having no sense of direction of where I wanted to head, it motivated me to set up a few goals for myself within my learning contract, in order to determine whether Cyber Security was an industry I wanted to get into and to ultimately gain a heightened understanding of Information Security in general, so that I can help others.

The main skillsets/goals I set myself were:
- Develop an `aesthetic` looking portfolio where potential employers can view the type of work I have achieved for Cyber Security
- Further practice my presentation skills, especially in translating technical content to everyday language, so that non-technical users can understand
- Gain enough experience to see whether I like the Cyber Security Industry or not (`Spoiler: I do!`)
- Actually decide what kind of grad role/internship I want to pursue!

Consequently, looking back to the learning contract and the goals I filled out in the first week, I strongly believe that I have met every single requirement on my learning contract:
![intross1.png](/images/intross1.png)
![intross2.png](/images/intross2.png)
***

The learning progression throughout the studio was definitely difficult, as I had to conduct extra research into certain concepts that I had trouble keeping up with, but it allowed me to gather different problem statements regarding real industry issues surrounding the cyber security industry. Moreover, the steady yet rising difficulty of the security challenges put me at the edge of my seat, as there were new technical content to be learnt every week. Additionally, by reflecting back on the [documentation](https://teechan.me/posts/) on what I have learnt every week, I am able to compare with myself from earlier weeks and then be able to judge/evaluate my overall performance for this studio.

Overall, it has been an extremely fun journey with my fellow students and the teaching team, where I have learnt new things, discovered the hidden potential within myself, communicated and collaborated with students I have never met before and gain a heightened understanding of the dire issues surrounding the cyber security industry today. Despite that my time here at summer studio has concluded does not mean my blog will not be updated every now and then. This blog can be used later on in the future to show potential employers what I have accomplished in this summer studio.

Thank you guys for everything! :)

#### Future Intentions
I have definitely learnt a lot from my summer studio and with this knowledge gained, I hope to teach others regarding what I have learnt.
In the future, I intend to:
- Meet the team at the next security conference (`Bsides Canberra 2020` in this case)
- Still unsure whether to lean towards UX or Cyber Security as I am still quite an indecisive person in general
- However, I now have a deeper insight into what the cyber security industry is like, based on my own input and suggestions from the cyber security industry professionals that came to visit our studio, and the typical workload that is presented
- Try and apply for security analyst internship roles
- Help educate others on information security and let them be aware of how important and impactful it is to their everyday lives
