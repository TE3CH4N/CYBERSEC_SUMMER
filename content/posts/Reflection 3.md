#### Introduction
***
***
This is the 3rd week of Cyber Security Summer Studio and I feel as if this week was much more manageable than last week with the ongoing support from my tutors. Nevertheless, the workload was still intense, but I definitely have a better understanding of what is expected of me now. Consequently, I immediately started to take more responsibility into documenting the daily tasks that I do, which can viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ArgGhNYr6NvSeAuEo6c_boSYJHig2hjp).

#### Week 3: Pros & Cons
*To-do List:*


***
***
###### Pros:
- Took some notes on other student presentations [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QMo1Nv-S7wjH2V15-KWU6a805jUiGyFo) (which I did not do last sprint)

- Plan a week 3 to do list on notebook
- Document notes on notion, which can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ArgGhNYr6NvSeAuEo6c_boSYJHig2hjp)
- Engaged with other students to collaborate on wargames and CTFs
- Asked what I wanted during the 1 on 1 consultation session regarding reflection feedback and log layout wise


***
###### Cons:
- Did not write any notes regarding other student presentations
- Did not do much research into my problem statement from Week 2
- Since the presentation deliverable was a priority, I procrastinated on polishing up reflection up until the weekend again (need to work on that)
- Did attempt some CTF challenges, but not enough as presentation deliverable and another presentation preparation for the careers subject I mentioned in week 1 were more of a priority

#### Weekly Recap

###### Monday (03/02):
***
***

We had our initial Monday scrum meeting and another common issue that I found was that everyone still had prograstination trouble as people had better preferences than MS teams...

- Pick web exploit topic
- Allocate tasks on notion
- Start gathering notes and useful links to view readable content



The rest of the day was yet again focused on [Capture the Flag](https://2019game.picoctf.com/â€‹) challenges. However, we were introduced to OWASP hacking challenges such as [OWASP Juice Shop](https://spacesnottabs.herokuapp.com/#/search).

This was a good time to attempt challenges outside my comfort zone, and document any progress made in my a different section. I came up with a separate section on my static site called logs, which keeps an 'audit' of my attempts at wargames on overthewire.org and CTF challenges on PicoCTF. These logs can be viewed [here](https://teechan.me/logs/). Additionally, to help me jumpstart the learning progress, there is an excellent site that explains different web attacks called [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/). This is where I could learn and understand about different web exploits through interesting demonstrations and engaging example scenarios, especially at a beginner level.

Not much was completed today as me and Hayden were focused on preparing another presentation deliverable for the careers subject that I mentioned in week 1. Nevertheless, while we waited for the other team members from our careers subject to arrive, we decided to watch short demonstration videos on our own about our respective web exploit topic as research. I find watching videos online, especially with a clear demonstration really helped me in understanding the content `that` much better. [Here](https://youtu.be/P38at6Tp8Ms) was a good video that I found to be very engaging.

###### Wednesday (29/01):

***

I met up with Anthony and Tyrone at UTS B2 to work on the presentation.
I suggested to use Canva again to design the slides because Canva is `aesthetically pleasing`
We each took turns editing our respective slides and added a relevant image to it as well
Suggested that Anthony should perform the demo since he was the one that led our team in picking broken access control as a web exploit topic, and was quite knowledgeable about it before any thorough research was conducted.
Quick practice run to test our presentation skills and to see if we were within the time limit
Split off back home --> Waited for Anthony to finish recording demo so I could put everything together --> download as ppt so it will be easier to `plug and present` on Thursday morning and practiced and practiced :)

###### Thursday (30/01):
We had our initial Thursday scrum meeting and another common issue that I found was that everyone still had prograstination trouble as people had better preferences than MS teams...
Today was our chosen web exploit topic (Broken Access Control) presentation.

###### Friday + Weekend (31/01 - 02/02):
I had to take a break from Summer Studio work to focus a little more in preparing for a "mock panel interview" on the following Monday for the CMITP careers subject. Therefore, not much was done except for updating the reflection, making sure I also document a list of goals to meet for next sprint and catch up on sleep :)

#### Conclusion
***
***
`TO RE-DO`To summarise, alongside the presentation deliverable that was due on Thursday, the guest speakers had also enlightened me on two different aspects within the IT security industry. Patrick talk about the relevance of utilising Linux in the Cyber Security industry. Whereas Robert briefed us on the history of IT security and the importance of being within the Cyber Security Industry. In addition, I have learnt a lot from the presentation deliverable and being cut off due to time constraints was unfortunate but it really taught me that I had to get straight to the point more. Moreover, the 1 on 1 session was the most beneficial this week as I felt that I have wanted to ask the questions that I needed to ask and the gentle encouragement to keep doing what I do was extremely beneficial to keep me motivated.

Next week I would like to achieve:
- Continue to be more disciplined and keep updating reflection whenever possible
- Should develop more confidence in asking other students for their slides
- Do more Linux hacking levels and even attempt a CTF solo or in a group if I can
- Conduct more research into more technical Cyber security content and see if I can translate or re-evaluate that given content into a more user-friendly one
