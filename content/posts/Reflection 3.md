#### Introduction
***
***
This is the 3rd week of Cyber Security Summer Studio and I feel as if this week was much more manageable than last week with the ongoing support from my tutors. Nevertheless, the workload was still intense, but I definitely have a better understanding of what is expected of me now. Consequently, I immediately started to take more responsibility into documenting the daily tasks that I do, which can viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/teechan/Submission-2-notes-d1c8d669faec4f2aa264e9a03ab76eea). This week we were introduced to two guest speakers (stakeholders), and had taught us a lot about their respective topics. Patrick Kelso (cloud manager) introduced us to interesting and unique variations of Linux and other window managers, but ultimately discussing the prevalence of using Linux in the IT security workplace.
The second speaker was Robert Mitchell, an engineer manager at Gitlab. He briefed us on the history of IT security and the evolution of IT security threats along with their appropriate risk management strategies. Thus, this provoked me into coming up with a problem statement. Throughout Robert Mitchell's discussion, generation 4 hacking involved countless IoT devices.

`"IoT devices may be compromised and used for performing massive DDoS attacks. Cybercriminals may try to exploit these poor security settings in both, home and workplace IoT devices, making them generate enormous amounts of traffic, in which any device is an attack vector."`

IoT devices these days focus on a simple UI, thus creating a satisfactory UX for many users. However, by simplifying IOT UI, essential security features such as advanced encryption and packet filtering are often disabled or just unavailable to users. Consequently, this allows attackers to compromise that particular IoT device, and use their 'collective bandwidth' to steal your information.

Furthermore, a method called `Fuzzing` can help you proactively improve the security of your IoT software. It is often recommended to new users as it ensures that your "business-critical software, including firmware, is resilient enough to withstand attacks and that your closed, hard-to-test IoT devices’ attack surfaces are hardened." *Synopsys Editorial Team 2017*.

#### Week 3: Pros & Cons
*To-do List:*


***
***
###### Pros:
- Plan to do list on notebook and document notes on notion
- View notes [here:](https://www.notion.so/teechan/Submission-2-notes-d1c8d669faec4f2aa264e9a03ab76eea)
- Engaged with other students and stakeholders
- This included talking to Patrick Kelso, and asking him about his experience working in IT security, especially in the government funded hospital where he talked about limited funding, which really provoked one of my problem statements
- This also includes talking with Robert and understanding that there any chances in the IT security field where UX/UI designers could thrive, and he suggested that many security products or technical content has difficulty providing a user-friendly layout for everyday users
- Asked what I wanted during the 1 on 1 consultation sessions regarding career goals and reflection two draft
***
###### Cons:
- Did not write any notes regarding other student presentations
- I have been procrastinating quite a bit since there was only the reflection due this week, which yet again led me to finish reflection on the weekend :(
- Not doing enough challenges
- Did not give enough feedback to tutors about their teaching style. However, if you guys are reading this, I would like to really **emphasise** my point again. `I really appreciate the effort you guys put in to teach us and the genuine personal connection you have provided me, which makes me feel very welcome and not afraid to ask questions. :)`

#### Weekly Recap
***
***
###### Monday (03/02):
***
***

We had our scrum meeting up first and a common issue that I found was that everyone had issues with communication trouble as people had better preferences than MS teams, our sprints needed more of a reflective statement about how we felt and Trello ended up being not effectively used since it was such a short deliverable. Today was the NMAP presentation and unfortunately we got cut off at 4 minutes. This was mainly due to one of our team members not keeping track of time, which resulted in me rushing my part. This taught me a lesson in time management and how you must get straight to the point when presenting a crucial topic, which is something I still struggle with because there is a lot I want to cover and inform others, but I am definitely working to get better at it!




The rest of the day was focused on [Capture the Flag](https://2019game.picoctf.com/​) challenges and Linux hacking challenges such as [OvertheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). This was a good time to do some external research and document any progress made in having a good arsenal within the Cyber Security industry. [Here's](https://www.notion.so/teechan/Bandit-3aad8912872740eaa8e2e3f3ca0e7b93) what I have so far for OvertheWire.

###### Friday + Weekend (31/01 - 02/02):
I had to take a break from Summer Studio work to focus a little more in preparing for a "mock panel interview" on the following Monday for the CMITP careers subject. Therefore, not much was done except for updating the reflection, making sure I also document a list of goals to meet for next sprint and catch up on sleep :)

#### Conclusion
***
***
To summarise, alongside the presentation deliverable that was due on Thursday, the guest speakers had also enlightened me on two different aspects within the IT security industry. Patrick talk about the relevance of utilising Linux in the Cyber Security industry. Whereas Robert briefed us on the history of IT security and the importance of being within the Cyber Security Industry. In addition, I have learnt a lot from the presentation deliverable and being cut off due to time constraints was unfortunate but it really taught me that I had to get straight to the point more. Moreover, the 1 on 1 session was the most beneficial this week as I felt that I have wanted to ask the questions that I needed to ask and the gentle encouragement to keep doing what I do was extremely beneficial to keep me motivated.

Next week I would like to achieve:
- Start being more disciplined and update reflection everyday even if its just a few dot points
- Make notes of other peers' presentation or kindly ask them for their slides to gain more knowledge and exposure about the IT security industry
- Do more Linux hacking levels and even attempt a CTF solo or in a group if I can
- Conduct more research into more technical Cyber security content and see if I can translate or re-evaluate that given content into a more user-friendly one
