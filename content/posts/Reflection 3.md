#### Introduction
***
***
This is the 3rd week of Cyber Security Summer Studio and I feel as if this week was similar to last week with the ongoing support from my tutors. The workload this week was not as intense as I have adjusted to it now, but I would still struggle with procrastinating on simple CTF attempts. Nevertheless, I still managed to attempt a new wargame called NATAS, and managed to update my bandit/PicoCTF logs to give them a more in-depth walkthrough rather than a `steps & solution` approach. Furthermore, I still am managing my time to document my daily tasks, which can viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ArgGhNYr6NvSeAuEo6c_boSYJHig2hjp).

#### Week 3: Pros & Cons
**To-do List:**
- Research our web exploit topic (Broken access control)
- Prepare a 6 minute presentation on the topic by Thursday
- Attempt more wargames/CTF's and maybe even start NATAs on [overthewire](www.overthewire.org)
- Regarding my HUGO server theme and layout, Anthony suggested about using:
- Since Anthony uses the same theme, ask him how to:
  - Use `favicon and app generator` to get your own logo on website tab

###### Pros:
- Took some notes on other student presentations [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QMo1Nv-S7wjH2V15-KWU6a805jUiGyFo) (which I did not do last sprint)
- Document notes on notion, which can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ArgGhNYr6NvSeAuEo6c_boSYJHig2hjp)
- Engaged with other students to collaborate on wargames and CTFs
- Logged my wargame and CTF attempts [here](https://teechan.me/logs/)
- Asked what I wanted during the 1 on 1 consultation session regarding reflection feedback and log layout wise

***
###### Cons:
- Did not do much research into my problem statement from Week 2
- Since there was no other deliverable this week, I procrastinated on polishing up links to my notes + logs and focused on another important deliverable up until the weekend again
- Did attempt some CTF challenges, but not as much as I wanted to, due to another presentation preparation for the careers subject I mentioned in week 1 was more of a priority

#### Weekly Recap

###### Monday (03/02):
***
***

We had our initial Monday scrum meeting and discussed our accomplishments and challenges over the weekend. The common accomplishments that I have found from the meeting was that everyone had learnt something, about Linux and basic networking skills (even if it was not significant) from the challenges they have been attempting over the week. Moreover here's what we attempted after we formed groups with completely new members of the class:
- Pick web exploit topic
- Allocate tasks on notion
- Start gathering notes and useful links to view readable content

The rest of the day was yet again focused on [Capture the Flag](https://2019game.picoctf.com/​) challenges. However, we were introduced to OWASP hacking challenges such as [OWASP Juice Shop](https://spacesnottabs.herokuapp.com/#/search).

This was a good time to attempt challenges outside my comfort zone, and document any progress made in my a different section. I came up with a separate section on my static site called logs, which keeps an 'audit' of my attempts at wargames on overthewire.org and CTF challenges on PicoCTF. These logs can be viewed [here](https://teechan.me/logs/). Additionally, to help me jumpstart the learning progress, there is an excellent site that explains different web attacks called [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/). This is where I could learn and understand about different web exploits through interesting demonstrations and engaging example scenarios, especially at a beginner level.

Not much was completed today as me and Hayden were focused on preparing another presentation deliverable for the careers subject that I mentioned in week 1. Nevertheless, while we waited for the other team members from our careers subject to arrive, we decided to watch short demonstration videos on our own about our respective web exploit topic as research. I find watching videos online, especially with a clear demonstration really helped me in understanding the content `that` much better. [Here](https://youtu.be/P38at6Tp8Ms) was a good video that I found to be very engaging.

###### Wednesday (05/02):

I met up with Anthony and Tyrone at UTS B2 to work on the presentation. I suggested to use Canva again to design the slides because its just so `aesthetically pleasing.` We then took turns in editing each of our slides and added a relevant image to it as well. I suggested that Anthony should perform the quick demonstration on Broken Access Control, since he was the one that led our team in picking broken access control as a web exploit topic, and was quite knowledgeable about it before any thorough research was conducted.

After a few hours of research, designing the slides and constructing a script, we decided to do a quick practice run to test our presentation skills and to see if we were within the time limit.

Then, we decided to split the work off so we could continue it back home. I then waited for Anthony to finish recording the demo so I could put everything together and download the slides as a `Powerpoint` file, so that it will be easier to just `plug and present` on Thursday morning. After all the group preparation was done, I practiced my script to a point where I could comfortably explain the content or without any other presentation issues.

###### Thursday (06/02):
We had our initial Thursday scrum meeting and another common issue that I found was that everyone still had procrastination trouble due to their own individual priorities, but was also due to we had so much fun attempting wargames and CTF Challenges that we got sidetracked.

Today we had to present our chosen web exploit topic (Broken Access Control). It went really well, given the fact we stuck to our script and presented it clearly without having to speed up any parts, was quite the surprise as we only had 2 days to work on this presentation. Additionally, I did not hesitate to note down other students' presentation notes as a form of research as it would be very beneficial. Consequently, I found out that different attack methods are already devastating enough, but when you pair two or more attacks together to compromise a company, it becomes even more deadly and may cost the whole company's profits.

###### Friday + Weekend (07/02 - 09/02):
Since the presentation deliverable is already over and there being no reflection submission due this week, I decided to only focus on completing the presentation deliverable for the careers subject alongside starting a new wargame on [overtheiwire][www.overthewire.org]. Initially, I have been slacking off a little bit as there was no reflection due this week, however, I still found it motivating to document it anyways, as it was better for the long term to look back and reflect upon, despite the fact that not much was accomplished these few days. Here's what we me and Hayden (fellow student) collabed on over the weekend:

#### Conclusion
***
***
To summarise, alongside the presentation deliverable that was due on Thursday, the challenges that I have attempted, really helped me understand the basics of Linux and further understand web exploit attacks and to mitigate against them.

Additionally, other student presentations have encouraged me to do some more research into their web exploit topic, to further learn and understand the severity of the attack and the need to why we need to mitigate against them. Moreover, the optional 1 on 1 session was as beneficial as last week because I needed to double check whether or not I was on track, find areas where I could further improve on and to further find some encouragement to help keep me motivated to document my tasks, challenges and sprint accomplishments :)

Next week I would like to achieve:
- Continue to be more disciplined and keep updating reflection whenever possible
- Do more Linux hacking levels and even attempt a CTF solo or in a group if I can
- Conduct more research into more technical Cyber security content and see if I can translate or re-evaluate that given content into a more user-friendly one
- Do more research into my conducted problem statement
- Try to attempt to meet more learning outcomes by next week if possible, even if it is as easygoing as this week
