#### Reflective Statement:

This week was a stressful week as Summer studio had started right after my 9am Careers Management class, which obviously interrupted it. Thus, I informed my Careers Management (CMITP) tutor few weeks prior to the start of Summer Studio, so that within the hour of class CMITP, my group and I will have presentation priority, so that we will not miss anything crucial.

As mentioned briefly in my introduction, I began this subject with limited knowledge or practical industry experience in cyber security, except for the few [War Games](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) I had attempted before coming to class on the first week and the preparation form that was provided to us prior to the start of the subject. Thus, the first week has been an eye-opening experience for me. When Summer Studio came about I was immediately confronted with an  abundance of "to-do" items within the first class [presentation](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/files/Studio%2002%20-%20Cyber%20Security%20-%20An%20Offensive%20Mindset?threadId=19:a7bbee14e65e4799990d7a5b5f0abbb6@thread.skype&ctx=channel&context=Week%25201).

Thus, within the first week I have learnt that meeting Subject Learning Outcomes (SLO's) is extremely crucial and reflecting back on this at the end of the week seemed therapeutic in a way that I could easily follow a strict learning outcome and adjust my workflow depending on whether or not I have or have not met those outcomes properly yet. Additionally, the workload has been challenging during the first week and without a due date and a guided structured learning approach, I would still be prograstinating :)
***
Here are a few concepts and tasks I had to be aware of during the first week of Summer Studio:
- Get familiar with the subject outline and its SLO's
- Join MS Teams
- Open Wiki tab under Cyber Security Summer Studio to follow instructions under Week 1
- Download Github education pack to enjoy all the content available for 12 months
- Create a [Github](https://github.com/TE3CH4N/CYBERSEC_SUMMER) Repository
- Have [notes](https://www.notion.so/Submission-1-a7f410f1c65547028ddf31ddfcb41712) ready so I can refer back to instructions and to keep track of what I am doing daily
- Learn how Git and how repositories work (learn how to gain remote access/push + pull)
- Learn about how Hugo server converts to HTML/CSS (external research) server
- Get your own domain name registered on NameCheap and start a static site which will contain all your sprints
- Transfer over custom DNS settings from Netlify to have static site deployed
- Do some external research about emerging Cyber Security issues in the real world
***
Additionally, during the first 2 days of Summer Studio, we ran into several Netlify and Hugo server issues, and especially with Australia Day round the corner, most of us had to focus on fixing certain issues with our static sites. Hence, our main goal for week 1 was instead to create a static site on Hugo, get it to deploy and document our sprints on the static site.

However, this delayed our first research task and group deliverable for the week, and halted the teamwork collaboration process. Consequently, throughout the week, I have been thoroughly researching and experimenting with different Hugo themes and playing around with the provided CSS file to fix up certain alignment and font issues. All sprints and current progress is required to be documented in a portfolio style for this Summer Studio, and for this subject, we are required to host our static site files on a Github repository and deploy it using Netlify.

The process of learning about Git, how to host files on Github then deploying it and the overall development of my static site was definitely difficult and a learning experience for me. The biggest 'hurdle' for this week was to get my Github files to deploy on Netlify as I have never hosted files on Github before then deploying it. Thus, this was definitely challenging but nevertheless, with the help of tutors: Jason and Larry, and certain fellow students: Anthony and David, I was able to overcome my hurdle and get my site to deploy successfully. However, certain instructions I did not write down as after executing the commands into terminal

Furthermore, I believe that I have met **SLO 4 and 5** to a great extent this first week, as I had no trouble in asking fellow tutors and students, especially students that I have not known previously, to review and critique my progression of the static site and asked them for help whenever I needed it. Moreover, I also believe the time I spent in class (especially the Wednesday Drop-in session) allowed me to continuously evaluate my progress through asking questions regarding my development of my static site and by looking through problems that other students had, allowed me to improve my communication skills by either collaborating with them to tackle a common problem or help them solve a problem that I previously had (view screenshots below).

##### Here are a few **errors** I managed to fix
##### + what I learnt from them:
![Screenshot1.png](/images/screenshot1.png)
![jasondiagram1.jpg](/images/jasondiagram1.jpg)


- I keep having "error: 'themes/' does not have a commit checked out "fatal: adding files failed" issue when trying to upload local repos to GitHub
- I fixed this by manually uploading all files onto my Github Repository, then cloning all files into a new local directory (real troublesome as I had to seek Jason out for help)
- The second screenshot shows Jason's explanation of how Netlify, Github, Namecheap and Hugo are all linked and stressed that if there is an issue with your Hugo theme, then it halts the whole deploy process. Thus, he and Larry suggested the solution to manually upload all files to Github, then cloning that into a new local directory
***

Another Problem I had was deploying site on netlify was it wans't the right hugo version:
![Screenshot3.png](/images/screenshot3.png)

- I fixed this by checking the version of HUGO on my terminal (version 0.62.2) and then i matched it on Netlify under Site Settings/build & deploy/Environment
***

In addition, I believe I have met **SLO 3** to a certain extent as I have utilised my technical skills and knowledge learnt from a previous subject called Web Systems to continually evaluate my own static site, improve upon it based on feedback and through error corrections mentioned above and help others that require assistance. Moreover, in regards to design thinking, I believe my static site was more focused towards a dark, minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing style, and limit the amount of icons and objects a reader has to review. Nevertheless, more could be achieved in the oncoming weeks to meet this outcome a little more as this was the first week and only basic terminal commands and HTML/CSS were required to effectively evaluate my own static site and my fellow students' sites.

Despite the fact that not much external research regarding an industry problem was required this week as part of our deliverable, and since our stakeholders (our tutors in this case) stressed that we should focus on our deploying our static sites more, no significant discussions about potential industry problems were held. However, a guest speaker came in on Thursday 23/02/2020 (Matthew Brennan) and talked about how he went from a Pen-Testing job to a more grounded security analyst role. This intrigued me to do some external [research](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/cybersecurity-trends-and-challenges-2018/) on potential industry problems and to learn more about Cyber Security Certifications. Consequently, although I did not meet the outcomes of **SLO 1 and SLO 2** I look forward to improve upon this next sprint by conducting more research into growing industry problems and discussing these with stakeholders.
